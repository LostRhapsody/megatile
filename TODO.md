# Megatile TODO

## Next Steps

- Add numbers to the status bar
- Sometimes, when opening a new window in an EMPTY workspace, the window is tiled as if there are MANY windows in that workspace. A case of it not being filtered correctly I imagine.
- Some windows, like VSCode, seem to not fit quite right. They are a bit wider or a bit taller for some weird reason.
- Still getting lots of fake windows. Had 3 open, but after shutting down, had 7 being tracked.
